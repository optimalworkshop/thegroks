  "body": "### The Groks\r\nThe Groks are a colony of small humanoids who live and work on a series of floating islands in the sky (a utopia of sorts). Insatiably curious, they are forever asking questions and running experiments in their endless quest to understand and improve the world around them.\r\n\r\nGroks love to share what they learn and enthusiastically build on each other’s work. Fascinated by a failed hypothesis and excited when they’re right, there’s no way to disappoint a Grok.\r\n\r\nGroks understand each other intuitively — sharing emerging patterns and evolving designs as they mindshare about all the things they’ve seen, heard, and felt throughout the day, each waking with a fresh batch of questions and ideas for making tomorrow all the better for everyone.\r\n",
